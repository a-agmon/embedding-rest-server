# Embedding REST Server

This is a REST service implemented in GO (using GIN as a web server) that essentially wraps embeddings of items (or words) that are typically used for recommendations. It enables a quick and efficient way to perform REST based similarity requests using embeddings generated by your favorite matrix factorization or ML model. You simply point the server to an embedding file and an item name-id mapping and it can start serving requests as below.
Although this is mainly for testing and debugging purposes, it runs a similarity search on an embedding really fast.
It returns an answer for a cosine similarity search over nearly 18K items, each represented by a vector of length 128, in about 30ms.
(Tested using the lastFM dataset)
Example for usage
```bash
curl [URL]:9090/mostsimilar \
-d '{"similarto":"Eminem", "topk":10}' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' -X GET | jq

```

```json
{
  "original": "Eminem",
  "similar": [
    "Eminem",
    "Ludacris",
    "Jay-Z",
    "Kanye West",
    "2Pac",
    "50 Cent",
    "Juno Reactor vs. Don Davis",
    "The Brothers Gutworm",
    "Black Eyed Peas",
    "Timbaland"
  ]

```
